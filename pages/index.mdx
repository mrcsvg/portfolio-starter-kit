# Marcus Garcia

Hey! I'm a Computer Engineer, with 18-year experience in IT projects. 

Along the way, I have performed several roles: From software engineering to IT business consultant and finally Product Management. 

Over the years, I have consolidated a generalist foundation, as I have worked with a huge variety of languages and technologies, from the big mainframes to some brand-new web frameworks. 

All this general knowledge and experiences (together with my curiosity) have helped me a lot in my career with Digital Products, which I have been dedicating myself to for since 2015.As a Product Manager, I've worked both with technical (like API or SDK definitions) and user-facing stuff products, in e-commerce (airlines) and payment industries. 

My last experience in the product field was at Mercado Pago, where I led an incredible product team, building Recurring Payment solutions to Latin Americans. Given the characteristics of my work at LATAM, since the end of 2023, I have been seeking ways to get closer to the academic environment, aiming for a master's degree in the coming years.

Recently, at LATAM Airlines, I have been leading teams that design and build data products using advanced analytics. Our mission is to leverage data and analytics to create innovative and personalized data products that optimize every touchpoint of the passenger journey. 

By harnessing the power of data, we aim to deliver exceptional customer experiences and drive revenue growth for LATAM Airlines.
